Postmortem: E-commerce Checkout Slowdown (18:00-20:00 PST)
Issue Summary:
Duration:
The e-commerce checkout process experienced slowdowns for two hours, from 6:00 PM PST to 8:00 PM PST on March 12th, 2024.

Impact:
Users encountered delays during the checkout process, with page load times increasing by an average of 3 seconds. This impacted approximately 20% of users attempting to checkout during the timeframe. No complete order failures were reported.
Root Cause:
The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the Redis cache layer led to cache invalidation issues, causing increased database load and slowing down the checkout process.

Timeline
18:00 PST: Monitoring alerts triggered due to a spike in database query times.
18:05 PST: The on-call engineer investigated and identified slowdowns in the checkout process.
18:10 PST - 18:45 PST: Initial investigation focused on the application code and database servers, assuming a potential code inefficiency or database bottleneck.
18:45 PST: No anomalies were found in the application code or database performance metrics. The investigation shifted towards potential caching issues.
19:00 PST: The Redis cache configuration was reviewed, revealing an expired cache TTL (Time To Live) setting for a critical checkout data key.
19:15 PST: The cache TTL for the checkout data key was corrected and the Redis service restarted.
19:30 PST: Database query times returned to normal levels, and checkout process performance improved.
20:00 PST: Monitoring confirmed stable operation, and the incident was declared resolved.

Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was a misconfigured cache TTL setting in Redis. A critical data key used during checkout had an expired TTL, causing the cache to bypass and overload the database with redundant queries for every checkout attempt.  This significantly increased database load and resulted in slower response times for the checkout process.
The resolution involved correcting the expired TTL setting for the checkout data key in the Redis configuration. The Redis service was then restarted to ensure the updated configuration took effect.  This restored proper caching functionality and alleviated the strain on the database, leading to faster checkout processing.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improve Cache Management: Review and update cache TTL settings for all critical data keys to ensure optimal performance.
Implement Monitoring for Cache Health: Establish monitoring for key cache metrics like hit rate and eviction rate to identify potential cache invalidation issues proactively.
Automated Testing for Cache Configuration Changes: Integrate automated tests into the deployment pipeline to verify the integrity of cache configurations before deployments.
Team Training on Caching Best Practices: I  Conducted training sessions for developers and operations teams on best practices for using caching effectively.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of future cache-related performance issues and ensure a smooth checkout experience for our users.
